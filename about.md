[!["I'm the one pointing towards the screen"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/cover.jpg)](http://www.readme.lk/saw-aces-hackathon-2016/)

I'm a hacker, writer, artist, philosophy and _many_ other things, too. I write various content
related to my different interests, but they are tagged to suit your preference in
browsing.

## The hacker

I work with technologies ranging from desktop to mostly the web, mobile and sometimes embedded 
systems. I'm interested in great visual and architectural design of software and web.

I work at [Embla Software Innovation](http://embla.asia) as a software engineer.

I'm a great believer and activist in software and information freedom. I'm enthusiastic
about information security philosophy, technology and issues and love active discussion.

I make contributions to various open-source 
projects including Jekyll, Wikimedia, Elementary OS, Mono and LESS CSS. I'm on GitHub as [NirmalL](https://github.com/NirmalL).

## The philospher

I'm an active free thinker and atheist, vocal about separation of religion and state. 
I'm active on social media about the abstract political issues of the world and like
learning, researching and especially discussing with the like-minded.

I'm a conservative/republican.
