[!["I'm the one pointing towards the screen"]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cover.jpg)](http://www.readme.lk/saw-aces-hackathon-2016/)

I'm a hacker, writer, artist, philosophy and _many_ other things, too. I write various content
related to my different interests, but they are tagged to suit your preference in
browsing.

## The artist and fan

I'm a painter, designer and (indie) comic artist. I also play the guitar, sing 
and spend time in fandoms and stories.

Big DC comics fan. Don't mind Marvel, but Deadpool is my role model (kinda).

Great fan of Sherlock, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Rick and Morty, etc. Let's talk about
this stuff!

Loves XKCD.

## The writer

I aspire to be a great writer and am working on _several_ stories at the time,
some comics, short stories and novels.

I like going through literature that inspire life and imagination. Greatest fan of JK Rowling.

## The hacker

I work with technologies ranging from desktop to mostly the web, mobile and sometimes embedded 
systems. I'm interested in great visual and architectural design of software and web.

I work at [Embla Software Innovation](http://embla.asia) as a software engineer.

I'm a great believer and activist in software and information freedom. I'm enthusiastic
about information security philosophy, technology and issues and love active discussion.

I make contributions to various open-source 
projects including Jekyll, Wikimedia, Elementary OS, Mono and LESS CSS. I'm on GitHub as [NirmalL](https://github.com/NirmalL).

Ruby is my favorite language and love of my life.

## The philospher

I'm an active free thinker and atheist, vocal about separation of religion and state. 
I'm active on social media about the abstract political issues of the world and like
learning, researching and especially discussing with the like-minded.

I like discussing artificial intelligence, the future of mankind, the nature 
and participate in movements that aim to protect the nature.
