## Backup notes

You may have a lot of valuable content in a number of sticky notes that you might 
want to migrate to a new installation/new PC or just make sure you won't lose them.

The content is saved as binary data at `%AppData%\Microsoft\Sticky Notes` as `StickyNotes.snt`.
Just back that file up and move it back to that folder when you need it back.

## Formatting shortcuts

### Text alignment

`ctrl r` aligns the selected content to the right and `ctrl l` to the left. `ctrl e` center-aligns.

### Basic formatting

To make text bold, italic and underlined use popular combinations like `ctrl b`, `ctrl i`, `ctrl u`.
To add a strikethrough, use `ctrl t`

### Font size

`ctrl shift >` increases the size of selected text while `ctrl shift <` decreases the size.

To make text into subscript, use `ctrl =` and use the `shift` in addition to make a superscript (`ctrl shift =`, i.e. `ctrl +`).

### Lists

`ctrl shift l` creates a list. Pressing that multiple times will change the format of the list:

1. Bullet lists (● ● ●)
2. Numbered list (1 2 3)
3. Lettered list (a b c)
4. Uppercase lettered list (A B C)
5. Roman numeral list (i ii iii)
6. Uppercase roman numeral list (I II III)

### General

Normal key combinations common to most applications are shared by Sticky Notes. For example,
`ctrl n` creates new notes while `ctrl d` deletes the current note. Normal copy-cut-paste-select 
key combinations are also possible (`ctrl c`, `ctrl x`, `ctrl v`).

`ctrl a` selects all the content in the note while `shift arrow` can help select text from the cursor 
to all four sides. To efficiently use keyboard-driven content selection, try `ctrl` (`shift ctrl arrow`) 
which will select word by word.

`ctrl arrow` can be used to move the cursor from word to word, which is why it can be used for word 
selection as in the above.

Undo and redo of changes is possible as usual with `ctrl z` and `ctrl y`.
